## Hi, I’m Gregg Thorpe

I run **First Place Positioning**. I help local and regional service businesses get **more calls and quote requests** from:
- Google Search and Maps (Local SEO / GBP)
- Technical SEO and on-page improvements
- Content systems (strategy + production + optimization)
- AI-era visibility (AI Overviews and citation-driven discovery)

### What I’m Focused On Now
- Building repeatable SEO systems that tie to leads, not vanity metrics
- Improving conversion paths after the click (calls, forms, booking)
- Learning to build small AI tools and micro-SaaS for marketing workflows

### Work With Me
If you want a quick visibility check and a clear plan of what to fix first, reach out.
